// Persistent, growable device and pinned-host scratch.
//
// The first version of this extension allocated and freed its scratch on every
// call, and it was no faster than the pure-torch path. The kernel was never the
// problem: device allocation and free are *synchronising* calls, and a pageable
// copy runs at roughly half the bandwidth of a pinned one
// because the driver stages it through an internal bounce buffer. Between them
// they cost more than the work.
//
// So the scratch lives as long as the `ImageOps` object and grows
// monotonically. That is the same bet torch's caching allocator makes, made
// here because this extension does not link torch.
